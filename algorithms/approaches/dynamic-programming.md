## Dynamic programming

The word **dynamic programming** is first used by **Richard Bellman**. According to him, word **dynamic** was used to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive. The word **programming** referred to the method to find an optimal program, i.e. a military schedule for training or logistics.

Generally, dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**.
