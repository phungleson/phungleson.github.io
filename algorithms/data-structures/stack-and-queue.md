## Stack and queue

### Stack

A stack is a ordered collection of elements where the main operations are the addition (push) and removal (pop) of elements from the top.

### Queue

A queue is a ordered collection of elements where the main operations are the addition of elements to the rear (enqueue) and removal of elements from the front (dequeue).
