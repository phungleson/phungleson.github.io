## Concepts

### Point

Point in Cartesian coordinate system is represented by an ordered pair `(x, y)` or an ordered triplet `(x, y, z)` called **coordinates**.

### Line

Line is a set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation.

* Linear equation $$ y = ax + b $$

  `a` is **slope** or **gradient** of the line.

  `b` is the **y-intercept** of the line.

* Line through two points $$ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) $$

  $$ {(x - x_1) \over (x_2 - x_1)} = {(y - y_1) \over (y_2 - y_1)} $$
