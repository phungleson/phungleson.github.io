## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of rules to be followed in order to solve a certain problem.

### Approaches

* [Brute force](/algorithms/approaches/brute-force/)
* [Divide and conquer](/algorithms/approaches/divide-and-conquer/)
* [Greedy](/algorithms/approaches/greedy/)
* [Dynamic programming](/algorithms/approaches/dynamic-programming/)

### Data structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

* [Concepts](/algorithms/data-structures/concepts/)
* [Stack and queue](/algorithms/data-structures/stack-and-queue/)
* [Priority queue](/algorithms/data-structures/priority-queue/)

### Hash Tables

Hash tables are a very practical way to maintain a dictionary.

* [Hash functions](/algorithms/hash-tables/hash-functions/)

### Graph

A graph `G = (V,E)` is a data-structure containning a set of vertices `V`, and a set of edges `E` between pairs of vertices from `V`.

* [Traversing a graph](/algorithms/graph/traversing-a-graph/)

### Tree

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path.

### Discrete mathematics

Discrete mathematics is the branch of mathematics dealing with objects that can assume only distinct, separated values.

* [Numerical systems](/algorithms/discrete-mathematics/numerical-systems/)
* [Combinatorics](/algorithms/discrete-mathematics/combinatorics/)
* [Number theory](/algorithms/discrete-mathematics/number-theory/)

### Analysis of algorithms

The analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of resources (such as time and storage) necessary to execute them.

* [Asymptotic analysis](/algorithms/analysis-of-algorithms/asymptotic-analysis/)

### Randomized algorithms

A randomized algorithm is an algorithm which employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic.
